### Directions
**Build** this module using **HTML** and **CSS** using a Github repository.

Add **states** to the stories such that stories 01 & 05 swap styles with
stories 02, 03, & 04 on hover.

Imagine how this module might **respond** to fit many different sized
screens, and then implement this behavior.

Add **javascript** that you think would improve the user experience
and performance of this module. Feel free to use JQuery, but avoid
other libraries and plugins.

This can be as **simple** as a static set of three files or as **complex** as a small application using a framework and a database.

We estimate that this should take no longer than a week, but please
send an update if you need more time.

### Remember:
* Commit messages count.
* Annotated code is good
* Legible code is better.
* Using all three is the **best**.
